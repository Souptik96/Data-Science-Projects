## Overview

This repository contains the code for an Email Spam Detection Model. The model is designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content and features. The project uses various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to build and evaluate the spam detection model.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- scikit-learn (v0.24+)
- XGBoost (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The email dataset used for this project can be found in the `emails.csv` file. The dataset contains email samples along with their labels (spam or ham).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the models, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data. The EDA includes visualizations to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, word clouds to analyze the most common words in both types of emails, and other relevant visualizations.

## Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing step, we convert the text data into numerical features suitable for training the machine learning models. We use techniques such as CountVectorizer or TF-IDF to transform the text data into a numerical format.

## Model Building

We build several machine learning models using different algorithms, including Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated on a test set to measure its performance.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. Additionally, confusion matrices are generated to analyze the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

## Making Predictions

Once the models are trained, they can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. We provide an example of how to predict the spam or ham label for a new email using the winning XGBoost model.

## Conclusion

The Email Spam Detection Model achieves high accuracy in classifying emails as spam or ham. After evaluating different machine learning algorithms, the XGBoost model emerged as the best performer with an accuracy of [insert accuracy score]. The model's precision, recall, and F1-score were also competitive, making it an effective tool for identifying spam emails.
