# Movie Database Analysis

This repository contains an exploration of a movie database using SQL queries. The database consists of tables related to movies, actors, directors, genres, and their relationships. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the movies, actors, and directors in the database through various SQL queries.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises several tables, each containing valuable information about movies, actors, directors, and more. The main tables of interest are:

- `movies`: Contains details about each movie, including its title, release year, and rank.
- `actors`: Provides information about actors, including their first name, last name, and ID.
- `directors`: Holds data about directors, including their first name, last name, and ID.
- `roles`: Specifies the roles played by actors in various movies.
- `movies_directors`: Links movies to their respective directors.
- `movies_genres`: Associates movies with their genres.

## Analytical Queries

### 1. Top rated movies, with their Actor name, director's name and genre of the movies.

To understand the distribution of movies across genres, a query was executed to count the number of movies in each genre. The results revealed insights into which genres are most prevalent in the dataset.

### 2. Number of Movies by Genre.

A query was formulated to identify the actors who have appeared in the most movies. This information provides an understanding of the actors' level of involvement in the film industry.

### 3. Finding the directors who has made highest number of movies (in the winner of Q2).

Queries were used to find the movies with the highest and lowest ranks, providing insights into the range of movie rankings present in the database.

### 4. Actors in Most Movies.

By specifying a particular release year, a query was employed to list all the movies released in that year. This enables exploration of movie releases within a specific time frame.

### 5. Movies with Highest and Lowest Rank.

To identify the actors who appeared in the top-ranked movies, a query was used to find actors associated with movies having the highest rank. This sheds light on the involvement of actors in critically acclaimed films.

And some more.
 
## Conclusion

The SQL queries applied to the movie database offered valuable insights into different aspects of the film industry. By leveraging the relationships between tables and employing aggregation functions, we were able to extract meaningful information about genres, actors, movie rankings, and more.

The queries presented in this analysis showcase the versatility of SQL in exploring and understanding complex datasets. The resulting insights can assist filmmakers, analysts, and enthusiasts in making informed decisions related to movies and the entertainment industry.
