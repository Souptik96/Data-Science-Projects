# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

## Overview
This project performs Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis using Python and Plotly. CLV is a crucial metric for businesses to determine the value of their customers over time, which helps in making data-driven decisions regarding customer acquisition, retention, and marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the "customer_acquisition_data.csv" dataset, which contains the following columns:
- `channel`: The acquisition channel through which customers were acquired.
- `cost`: The cost of acquiring each customer.
- `revenue`: The revenue generated from each customer.
- `conversion_rate`: The conversion rate of customers for each channel.

## Analysis Steps
The analysis consists of the following steps:

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into Python using the Pandas library.

2. Distribution Visualization: Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of acquisition cost and revenue generated by customers.

3. Customer Acquisition Cost by Channel: Bar chart visualizing the mean acquisition cost for each channel is created.

4. Conversion Rate by Channel: Bar chart visualizing the mean conversion rate for each channel is created.

5. Total Revenue by Channel: Pie chart showing the proportion of total revenue contributed by each channel is created.

6. Return on Investment (ROI) by Channel: Bar chart visualizing the ROI for each channel is created.

7. Customer Lifetime Value by Channel: Bar chart comparing the CLTV across different channels is created.

8. CLTV Distribution by Channel: Box plot showing the distribution of CLTV for 'social media' and 'referral' channels is created.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly: Interactive data visualization.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

3. Place the "customer_acquisition_data.csv" file in the project folder.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Conclusion
The Customer Lifetime Value Analysis provides insights into customer acquisition cost, revenue, conversion rates, and lifetime value across different channels. The analysis can help businesses make informed decisions regarding customer acquisition, retention, and marketing strategies, ultimately leading to optimized business growth and profitability.
