Problem Statement:
Food Delivery Time Prediction To predict the food delivery time in real-time, we need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, we need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance.

Conclusion:
In order to make real-time predictions for food delivery time, it is important to determine the distance between the food preparation location and the delivery destination. Once the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations is obtained, the next step is to identify the correlations between the historical delivery times for the same distance, as recorded by the delivery partners. This analysis will help establish patterns and relationships that can be used to predict future food delivery times accurately.
